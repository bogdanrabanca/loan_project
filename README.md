# loan_project

This project examines data from Prosper Loans. Most of it follows my brainstorming in analyzing the data, so it lacks a clear analytical structure. As I find insights that I consider interesting, I add them in a separate section at the end.

Things I would like to add: an analysis of different variables over time.
